                <ul class="faq-body">
                    <p>Pneumonia may cause complications, especially in people with weakened immune systems or chronic conditions, such as diabetes.
                        Complications may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                    <li><b>Worsened chronic conditions.</b>
                        If you have certain preexisting health conditions, pneumonia could make them worse.
                        These conditions include congestive heart failure and emphysema. For certain people,
                        pneumonia increases their risk of having a heart attack.</li>
                    <li><b>Bacteremia.</b>
                    Bacteria from the pneumonia infection may spread to your bloodstream.
                    This can lead to dangerously low blood pressure, septic shock, and, in some cases,
                        organ failure.</li>
                    <li><b>Lung abscesses.</b>
                        These are cavities in the lungs that contain pus.
                        Antibiotics can treat them. Sometimes they may require drainage or surgery to
                        remove the pus.</li>
                    <li><b>Impaired breathing.</b>
                        You may have trouble getting enough oxygen when you breathe. Y
                        ou may need to use a ventilator.</li></ul>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Pneumonia that occurs during pregnancy is called maternal pneumonia.
                        Pregnant people are more at risk of developing conditions like pneumonia.
                        This is due to the natural suppression of the immune system that happens during pregnancy.
                        The symptoms of pneumonia don’t differ by trimester. However, you may notice some of
                        them more later on in your pregnancy due to other discomforts you may be encountering. <br>
                        If you’re pregnant, contact your doctor as soon as you start experiencing
                        symptoms of pneumonia. Maternal pneumonia can lead to a variety of complications,
                        such as premature birth and low birth weight.</p>

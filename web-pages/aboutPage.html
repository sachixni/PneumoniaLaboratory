				<h1>What is pneumonia?</h1><br>

				<p class="par">Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
                    The infection leads to inflammation in the air sacs of the lungs, which are called alveoli.
                    The alveoli fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe. Both viral and bacterial pneumonia are contagious.
                    This means they can spread from person to person through inhalation of airborne droplets from a sneeze or cough.
                    You can also get these types of pneumonia by coming into contact with surfaces or objects that are contaminated
                    with pneumonia-causing bacteria or viruses. You can contract fungal pneumonia from the environment.
                    It does not spread from person to person.<br><br>
                Pneumonia is further classified according to where or how it was acquired:</p>
                <ol class="par">
                    <li><strong>Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).</strong>
                        This type of bacterial pneumonia is acquired during a hospital stay. It can be more serious than other types,
                        as the bacteria involved may be more resistant to antibiotics.</li>

                    <li><strong>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).</strong>
                        This refers to pneumonia that’s acquired outside of a medical or institutional setting.</li>

                    <li><strong>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).</strong>
                        When people who are using a ventilator get pneumonia, it’s called VAP.</li>

                    <li><strong>Aspiration pneumonia.</strong>
                        Inhaling bacteria into your lungs from food, drink, or saliva can cause aspiration pneumonia.
                        It’s more likely to occur if you have a swallowing problem,
                        or if you’re too sedated from the use of medications, alcohol, or other drugs.</li>

				<h1 style="text-align: center;">Causes</h1><br>

				<p class="par">Pneumonia happens when germs get into your lungs and cause an infection.
                    The immune system’s reaction to clear the infection results in inflammation of the
                    lung’s air sacs (alveoli). This inflammation can eventually cause the air sacs to
                    fill up with pus and liquids, causing pneumonia symptoms. Several types of infectious
                    agents can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.</p>

				<p class="par">Your doctor will start by taking your medical history. They’ll ask you
                    questions about when your symptoms first appeared and your health in general.
                    They’ll then give you a physical exam. This will include listening to your lungs
                    with a stethoscope for any abnormal sounds, such as crackling. Depending on the
                    severity of your symptoms and your risk of complications, your doctor may also order
                    one or more of these tests:</p>

                <dl class="par" style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">
                    <dt><b>Chest X-ray</b></dt>
                    <dd>An X-ray helps your doctor look for signs of inflammation in your chest.
                        If inflammation is present, the X-ray can also inform your doctor about its
                        location and extent.</dd><br>

                    <dt><b>Blood culture</b></dt>
                    <dd>This test uses a blood sample to confirm an infection. Culturing can also
                        help identify what may be causing your condition.</dd><br>

                    <dt><b>Sputum culture</b></dt>
                    <dd>During a sputum culture, a sample of mucus is collected after you’ve coughed deeply.
                        It’s then sent to a lab to be analyzed to identify the cause of the infection.</dd><br>

                    <dt><b>Pulse oximetry</b></dt>
                    <dd>A pulse oximetry measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. A sensor placed on one
                        of your fingers can indicate whether your lungs are moving enough oxygen through your
                        bloodstream.</dd><br>

                    <dt><b>CT scan</b></dt>
                    <dd>CT scans provide a clearer and more detailed picture of your lungs.</dd><br>

                    <dt><b>Fluid sample</b></dt>
                    <dd>If your doctor suspects there’s fluid in the pleural space of your chest,
                        they may take a fluid sample using a needle placed between your ribs. This test
                        can help identify the cause of your infection.</dd><br>

                    <dt><b>Bronchoscopy</b></dt>
                    <dd>A bronchoscopy looks into the airways in your lungs. It does this using a camera
                        on the end of a flexible tube that’s gently guided down your throat and into your lungs.</dd><br>

                <p class="par">PA variety of infectious agents cause pneumonia. With proper recognition
                    and treatment, many cases of pneumonia can be cleared without complications.
                    For bacterial infections, stopping your antibiotics early can cause the infection
                    to not clear completely. This means your pneumonia could come back. Stopping
                    antibiotics early can also contribute to antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic-resistant
                    infections are more difficult to treat.Viral pneumonia often resolves in 1 to 3 weeks
                    with at-home treatment. In some cases, you may need antivirals. Antifungal medications
                    treat fungal pneumonia. It may require a longer period of treatment.</p>

                <p class="par">Most people respond to treatment and recover from pneumonia. Like your
                    treatment, your recovery time will depend on the type of pneumonia you have, how
                    severe it is, and your general health.</p>

                <p class="par">A younger person may feel back to normal in a week after treatment.
                    Others may take longer to recover and may have lingering fatigue.
                    If your symptoms are severe, your recovery may take several weeks.</p>
